    <h1>Greatest Basketball Players of All Time</h1>
    <div class="blogs">

        <div class="section1">The greatest basketball player of all time is widely considered Michael Jordan by the
            majority of basketball fans. He was the Chicago Bulls shooting guard from the 1980s-90s.He has 6
            championship titles under his name. In my humble opinion, he isn't even a top 50 player as he played against
            plumbers and is highly overrated.

        <div class="section1">My GOAT is Dennis Schroder, he won the 6th many of the year award in 2020 and is a better
            3 point shooter than Michael Jordan according to the percentages. He would beat Jordan in a 1 on 1, and he
            still has a hairline unlike the
            supposed "GOAT". It
            was once rumored he turned down 84 million dollars to take 5 million instead, left the Lakers for the
            Celtics.

        <div class="section1"> Sam Cassell is one of the most underrated and handsome NBA players in NBA history. He has
            as many rings as Stephen Curry, Larry Bird, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala. He also has more combined rings
            than Charles Barkley, Allen Iverson, Tracy McGrady, James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul, and the
            list goes on.

    <h2> Honorable Mentions </h2>
    <div class="blogs2">

        <div class="section1">Michael Kidd Ghilchrist is one of the premier and top notch shooters of all time, just
            look at his immaculate jumpshot. It is textbook, for reference in his peak he shot 42.9% from three point
            range. That is higher than another all time great shooter than Steph Curry did this past season 2020-21
            season (42.1%) which is regarded as Stephen Curry's best season yet. He was also drafted above Damian
            Lillard and Bradley Beal. The sharpshooter is currently unsigned.

        <div id="section1">Andre Iguodala is a 3 time NBA champ with a finals MVP, which is more than his long time
            teammate Steph Curry which means that he carried him to 3 NBA titles and was absolutely the best in 1 of
            them, meanwhile Steph Curry has never been the best player on his own team. Andre Iguodala is also
            incredibly clutch. In the infamous words of Max Kellerman, "With the fate of the universe on the line, I
            want Iguodala."
